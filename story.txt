It was 19th November 2018.
It was his birthday. His first birthday with me.
And his last day with me before his departure. had declined all my classes and work for
that day. Well, I didn't know why I had been doing that. I was broke. I had only 200/- left in
my purse.

Meanwhile, my phone rang.. It was from him. A mild smile flashed on my face.
"Good morning", I said as I recieved the call.
"Uh.. someone became early bird today. I thought I'll hear your sleepy voice. What a
surprise!!! Is this the birthday surprise?", he laughed.
